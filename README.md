# Memoarr-Card-Game
This project is a console-based C++ version of the Memoarr! memory game. It was developed for CSI2772 at the University of Ottawa. The game can be played by 2 to 4 players and uses an object-oriented design that represents all main parts of the game, including players, cards, the game board, decks, and rules.

The implementation includes the basic game and advanced expert modes. These feature an expert display mode and extra rule mechanics related to specific animals. The focus was on making the code easy to maintain and extend, with clean structures. It uses C++ features like templates, inheritance, const-correctness, operator overloading, and the standard library.
